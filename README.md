# AVL TREE:
AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes.The difference between the height of every left and right sub tree of every node in the tree is either (-1,0,1). means any node with these values are balanced only  balance factor should be less than or equal to 1
# BALANCE FACTOR:
Balance Factor = height of Left Subtree – height of Right Subtree.
# TPYES OF ROTATION:
• Single Left Rotation (LL Rotation) \
•	Single Right Rotation (RR Rotation) \
•	Left Right Rotation (LR Rotation) \
•	Right Left Rotation (RL Rotation) \
# IMPORTANT NOTE:
Here one important thing is that no matter whatever the size of binary tree or how many nodes are present in binary search tree but rotations can only be performed on three nodes only we look only for the three nodes and tried to arranged them or rotate them in AVL TREE
# FUNCTIONS OF AVL TREE:
Insertion ()
Search()
Delete ()
InOrder ()
PostOrder()
PreOrder()
Predecessor()
Successor()
GetHeight()
FindMax()
FindMin()
Rotate left ()
Rotate right ()
ReBlance()
BalanaceFactor()
# ADVANTAGES:
# HEIGHT OF AVL
•	 The height of the AVL tree is always balanced. The height never grows beyond log N, where N is the total number of nodes in the tree.
# COMPLEXITY
•	It gives better search time complexity when compared to simple Binary Search trees.
•	Time Complexity =O(Log n)
# CAPABILITY
•	AVL trees have self-balancing capabilities
